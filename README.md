# Statistics-Notebook
This began as the textbook for Intermediate Statistics (Math 325) at BYU-Idaho. It aims to become a personal notebook for performing and interpreting statistical analyses in R. If you want to see my work and my different analysis please look at the Analysis folder. There feel free to look at the .rmd files for the code.
