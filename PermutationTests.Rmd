#### Overview

<div style="padding-left:30px;">
In almost all hypothesis testing scenarios, the null hypothesis can be interpreted as follows. 

<div style="padding-left:15px;padding-right:15px;">
$H_0$: Any pattern that has been witnessed in the sampled data is simply due to random chance.
</div>

Permutation Tests depend completely on this single idea. If all patterns in the data really are simply due to random chance, then the null hypothesis is true. Further, random **re**-samples of the data should show similar lack of patterns. However, if the pattern in the data is *real*, then random **re**-samples of the data will show very different patterns from the original.

Consider the following image. In that image, the toy blocks on the left show a clear pattern or structure. They are nicely organized into colored piles. This suggests a *real* pattern that is not random. Someone certainly organized those blocks into that pattern. The blocks didn't land that way by random chance. On the other hand, the pile of toy blocks shown on the right is certainly a random pattern. This is a pattern that would result if the toy blocks were put into a bag, shaken up, and dumped out. This is the idea of the permutation test. If there is structure in the data, then "mixing up the data and dumping it out again" will show very different patterns from the original. However, if the data was just random to begin with, then we would see a similar pattern by "mixing up the data and dumping it out again."

The process of a permutation test is:

1. Compute a test statistic for the original data.
2. Re-sample the data ("shake it up and dump it out") thousands of times, computing a new test statistic each time, to create a sampling distribution of the test statistic.
3. Compute the p-value of the permutation test as the percentage of test statistics that are as extreme or more extreme than the one originally observed.

In review, the sampling distribution is created by permuting (randomly rearranging) the data thousands of times and calculating a test statistic on each permuted version of the data. A histogram of the test statistics then provides the sampling distribution of the test statistic needed to compute the p-value of the original test statistic.

#### Explanation

<div style="padding-left:30px;">

The most difficult part of a permutation test is in the random permuting of the data. How the permuting is performed depends on the type of hypothesis test being performed. It is important to remember that the permutation test only changes the way the p-value is calculated. Everything else about the original test is unchanged when switching to a permutation test.

##### Paired Data Example

See the [Sleep Paired t Test](./Analyses/SleepPairedt.html) example for the background and context of the study. Here is how to perform the test as a permutation test instead of a t test.

The question that this `sleep` data can answer concerns which drug is more effective at increasing the amount of extra sleep an individual receives. The associated hypotheses would be
$$
  H_0: \mu_d = 0
$$
$$
  H_a: \mu_d \neq 0
$$
where $\mu_d$ denotes the true mean of the differences between the observations for each drug obtained from each individual. Differences would be obtained by $d_i = \text{extra}_{1i} - \text{extra}_{2i}$. 

To perform a permutation test of the hypothesis that the drugs are equally effective, we use the following code.

```{r}
# Perform the initial test:
myTest <- with(sleep, t.test(extra[group==1], extra[group==2], paired = TRUE, mu = 0))
# Get the test statistic from the test:
observedTestStat <- myTest$statistic


# Obtain the permutation sampling distribution 
N <- 2000
permutedTestStats <- rep(NA, N)
for (i in 1:N){
  permuteData <- sample(x=c(-1,1), size=10, replace=TRUE) 
  permutedTest <- with(sleep, t.test(permuteData*(extra[group==1] - extra[group==2]), mu = 0))
  #Note, t.test(group1 - group2) is the same as t.test(group1, group2, paired=TRUE).
  permutedTestStats[i] <- permutedTest$statistic
}
hist(permutedTestStats)
abline(v=observedTestStat, col='skyblue', lwd=3)

# Greater than p-value: (not what we want here)
sum(permutedTestStats >= observedTestStat)/N


# Less than p-value:
sum(permutedTestStats <= observedTestStat)/N
# Correct two sided p-value for this study:
2*sum(permutedTestStats <= observedTestStat)/N

```

<a href="javascript:showhide('ItTest')">Independent Samples t Test (and Wilcoxon) <span style="font-size:8pt;">(click to show/hide)</span></a>

<div id="ItTest" style="display:none;">

For the independent sample t Test, we will use the data from the [independent sleep](Analyses/SleepIndependentt.html) analysis.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# First run the initial test and gain the test statistic:
myTest <- t.test(extra ~ group, data = sleep, mu = 0)
observedTestStat <- myTest$statistic

# Now we run the permutation for a distribution of test statistics
N <- 2000
permutedTestStats <- rep(NA, N)
for (i in 1:N){
  permutedData <- sample(sleep$group)
  permutedTest <- t.test(extra ~ permutedData, data = sleep, mu = 0)
  permutedTestStats[i] <- permutedTest$statistic
}

# Now we create a histogram of that distribution
hist(permutedTestStats, col = "skyblue")
abline(v = observedTestStat, col = "red", lwd = 3)

#Greater-Than p-value: Not the correct one in this case
sum(permutedTestStats >= observedTestStat)/N

# Less-Than p-value: This is the corret one
sum(permutedTestStats <= observedTestStat)/N

# Two-Sided p-value
2*sum(permutedTestStats <= observedTestStat)/N
```

**Note** The Kruskal-Wallis Rank Sum test is ran using the same code except with `myTest <- kruskal.test(y ~ X, data)` instead.

<a href="javascript:showhide('ANOVA')">ANOVA <span style="font-size:8pt;">(click to show/hide)</span></a>

<div id="ANOVA" style="display:none;">

##### One-Way ANOVA

For this example, we will use the data from the [chick weights](Analyses/chickwtsOneWayANOVA.html) analysis.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Again, we run the initial test and find the test statistic
myTest <- aov(weight ~ feed, data = chickwts)
observedTestStat <- summary(myTest)[[1]]$`F value`[1]

# For this permutation, we need to shake up the groups similar to the Independent Sample example
N <- 2000
permutedTestStats <- rep(NA, N)
for (i in 1:N){
  permutedData <- sample(chickwts$weight)
  permutedTest <- aov(permutedData ~ feed, data = chickwts)
  permutedTestStats[i] <- summary(permutedTest)[[1]]$`F value`[1]
}

# The histogram of this distribution gives an interesting insight into the results
hist(permutedTestStats, col = "skyblue", xlim = c(0,16))
abline(v = observedTestStat, col = "red", lwd = 3)

# Here is the greater-than p-value:
sum(permutedTestStats >= observedTestStat)/N

# Here is the less-than p-value: not the one that we want
sum(permutedTestStats <= observedTestStat)/N

# And here is the two-sided p-value: the same used in the original analysis
2*sum(permutedTestStats >= observedTestStat)/N
```

##### Two-Way ANOVA

For the two-way ANOVA, I will use the data from the [warpbreaks](Analyses/warpbreaksTwoWayANOVA.html) analysis.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# The initial test is done in the same way as one-way ANOVA but there is a little more to find the test statistic
myTest <- aov(breaks ~ wool + tension + wool:tension, data=warpbreaks)

# This first test statistic is the comparison between the two types of wool
observedTestStatW <- summary(myTest)[[1]]$`F value`[1]

# This second test statistic is the comparison between the three types of tension
observedTestStatT <- summary(myTest)[[1]]$`F value`[2]

# The third test statistic is the comparison of the interaction of wool types and tension
observedTestStatWT <- summary(myTest)[[1]]$`F value`[3]

# Now comes three different permutations for the test. First is for wool, second is for tension, and third is the interaction
N <- 2000
permutedTestStatsW <- rep(NA, N)
permutedTestStatsT <- rep(NA, N)
permutedTestStatsWT <- rep(NA, N)
for (i in 1:N){
  permuteData <- sample(warpbreaks$breaks)
  permutedTest <- aov(permuteData ~ wool + tension + wool:tension, data=warpbreaks)
  permutedTestStatsW[i] <- summary(permutedTest)[[1]]$`F value`[1]
  permutedTestStatsT[i] <- summary(permutedTest)[[1]]$`F value`[2]
  permutedTestStatsWT[i] <- summary(permutedTest)[[1]]$`F value`[3]
}

# We likewise need three differenct plots to show the distribution. First is wool, second is tension, and third is the interaction
hist(permutedTestStatsW, col = "skyblue", xlim = c(3,14))
abline(v = observedTestStatW, col = "red", lwd = 3)

hist(permutedTestStatsT, col = "skyblue")
abline(v = observedTestStatT, col = "red", lwd = 3)

hist(permutedTestStatsWT, col = "skyblue")
abline(v = observedTestStatWT, col = "red", lwd = 3)

# Greater-than p-value: the three situations are in order
sum(permutedTestStatsW >= observedTestStatW)/N

sum(permutedTestStatsT >= observedTestStatT)/N

sum(permutedTestStatsWT >= observedTestStatWT)/N

# Less-than p-value: again, they are in order
sum(permutedTestStatsW <= observedTestStatW)/N

sum(permutedTestStatsT <= observedTestStatT)/N

sum(permutedTestStatsWT <= observedTestStatWT)/N

# Two-sided p-values:
2*sum(permutedTestStatsW >= observedTestStatW)/N

2*sum(permutedTestStatsT >= observedTestStatT)/N

2*sum(permutedTestStatsWT >= observedTestStatWT)/N

For this example, I will use the `trees` dataset to compare the `Girth` and `Height` of black cherry trees.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# The test and then the test statistic is found in a similar way to that of an ANOVA (this is the t statistic)
myTest <- lm(Height ~ Girth, data = trees)
observedTestStat <- summary(myTest)[[4]][2,3]

# The permutation part is set up in this way
N <- 2000
permutedTestStats <- rep(NA, N)
for (i in 1:N){
  permutedData <- sample(trees$Height)
  permutedTest <- lm(permutedData ~ Girth, data = trees)
  permutedTestStats[i] <- summary(permutedTest)[[4]][2,3]
}

# Here, as before, is the histogram of the distribution of the test statistics
hist(permutedTestStats, col = "skyblue")
abline(v = observedTestStat, col = "red", lwd = 3)

# Less-than p-value:
sum(permutedTestStats <= observedTestStat)/N
